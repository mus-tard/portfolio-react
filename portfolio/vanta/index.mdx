## Project
### A transition from social media to web media
<SectionSummary
    summary="A local-Ottawa construction business founder wanted to create a website for his prospective clients."
 />
Before the landing page project, this local Ottawa-area construction contractor operated under a different name and its online presence existed on social media only. Customers would use social media to communicate with the founder, or to refer new clients. He posted pictures of his projects to create a small momentum of lead generation. To continue this momentum, the founder believed a website would help. 

## Objective
### Start small, dream large
<SectionSummary
    summary="The objective became designing and developing a website to enable the founder to connect with clients. We focused on starting small by building a landing page."
 />
The founder requested a multi-paged website that described all his company's products and services. His plan was to point interested parties there to convert them into prospects requesting a quote.

I pitched the smallest version of this idea: we could get started with a single landing page. This was the solution we decided on together, it being the more cost effective option, as well as the fastest way to validate our assumptions and create a baseline of data for future steps.

- Design a landing page.
- Build the landing page.
- Publish the landing page on a new domain.


## Work
### Build it and they will come
<SectionSummary
    summary="I designed the landing page using Figma, sourced and edited the content, and developed it using React, then published it online."
 />
I met with the founder after the pitch meeting twice, after both the design and development phases.
- I designed the landing page in Figma in about 20 hours.
- I helped the founder reverse-engineer a design for his logo in Illustrator.
- I sourced the images from free photo sites and the founder's Instagram feed. 
- I edited the assets in Photoshop to match the tone. 
- I developed the landing page in React in about 20 hours.
- I helped the founder purchase the domain name.
- I published the website using Netlify and ensured the form sent entries via email.

## End Result
### Announcing the new and shiny
<SectionSummary
    summary="Built a page the founder loved in about 40 hours."
 />
- The founder changed his name to a shorter, more marketable business name based on my recommendation.
- Produced a website in two weeks that the founder loved.
- Helped the founder take the first step in web communication.
- Enabled information for future steps, via future analysis of Google Analytics quantitative and qualitative data.

## Reflection
### Long-term relationships for lasting impact
<SectionSummary
    summary="Developing relations with clients that focus on long-term problem resolutions, rather than short-term solutions is where I'd like to go in the future."
 />
In an effort to keep my price competitive, my offer of an essential-tasks-only approach was selected over other UX or marketing projects. While I'm grateful that I could provide the founder a web presence as requested, I feel as if my design process should be more impactful. Next time, I want to spend more time refining my client's goal in measurable terms, so that I can recommend UX practices to ensure that goal. I want to work with clients more closely on a long-term basis to persistently iterate on solving a problem.
