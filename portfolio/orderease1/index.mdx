## Project
### Better looking = more leads
<SectionSummary
    summary="A resource-strapped team strove to improve the website's ability to generate leads by hiring an intern to improve it's appearance."
 />
Before I began as a web design and marketing intern and started their CMS redesign, the site was managed by a single person. Evidence for the benefits of user testing or design thinking had yet to be felt. Therefore their design strategy was to improve the website's aesthetics to increase its ability to generate leads. It was powered by an older HubSpot theme that was purchased years ago that was difficult to update. Due to time and budget constraints, only the most practical and aesthetic-based design practices could be employed.

## Objective
### Upgrades
<SectionSummary
    summary="The goal was to improve the homepage appearance by improving consistency and responsiveness. My goal was to ensure team self-sufficiency after I left the company."
 />
As the outdated theme was used for years, content updates created an inconsistant appearance and issues with mobile responsiveness. To fix this, the team would sometimes use technical solutions like CSS to mitigate the issues which could cause further design inconsistencies.
Since it was a marketing website, the design was not effectively representing the company and could be generating more leads.

Key objectives: 
- Generate more leads by improving the appearance of the homepage.
- Simplify content creation by installing a modern theme.
- Create new elements that would better represent the company and describe it's products and services.

## Work
### New theme, new tricks
<SectionSummary
    summary="I installed a new theme that had drag and drop features. Then I developed a few elements that included new illustrations, photos and balanced content."
 />
- I convinced the team to install an available template from the HubSpot store, instead of creating a bespoke design from scratch.
- I researched, installed, and recieved approval for a new theme that had drag and drop features. 
- I used the new theme to create a 3-4 different page elements that helped showcase various descriptions of their product and its merits.
- I wrote and edited content to create concise descriptions of key points and ensure a visually balanced appearance.
- To accompany the content, I found free yet appealing photos to attract the eye and created interface diagrams that presented specific product features.

## End Result
### Looking good
<SectionSummary
    summary="A new theme improved aesthetics and self-sufficiency."
 />
- The new modern theme has been published on the website's homepage.
- The homepage now has an improved asethetic appearance.
- These changes were done after I had left the company, which indicates self-sufficiency.

## Reflection
### Design by communication
<SectionSummary
    summary="Flexibility in design techniques helps solve real world problems."
 />
I learned that flexibility is required when applying design theory and practices in the real world. Client preference, budget or time constraints can prevent activities like user testing or a design-thinking-based iterative process. I realized that in these cases, an understanding of fundamental design princples and strong communication skills are needed to enable the best possible design.
